### Lily's Science Interests
- decided on developmental psych because it's closest to what Lily envisons doing in the future
    - help students learn, but not be a teacher
    - learn about deficits, disorders, etc.
    - help families
    - background working with children; bearcat buddies, younger family members
    - interested in the control we have over a child's upbringing
- specifically picked UC because of the neuropsychology track
- staying less clinical for now
- looking for basic research skills for now, eventually clinical (?)
    - grad programs Lily likes: 2 basic science, 1 clinical
