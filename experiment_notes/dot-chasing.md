Have people walk around and fixate at a moving dot on the ground

Does the retinal flow paper predict human behavior?

Perturbing flow

Find a mapping between retinal flow and full-body kinematics
`builds off of Matthis et al 2022`

## Dot Jumps
- dot jumps (when participant gets close enough to it)
- participant follows the dot
- vary where the dot jumps to (L/R)
    - also, could randomize it (*probably randomize it*)
> how far away was the next dot, and in which direction did they turn?

> Search pattern

## Dot Fixation - Walk to goal
- dot stays in the same place
- walk to goal, goal is to L/R Front of dot
